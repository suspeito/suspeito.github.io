            Suspeito is an artistic collective formed by the designer and engineer João Dias-Oliveira and by the architects Nuno Mota and Rossana Ribeiro. Beginning with early collaborations in 2016, it was only in 2018 that the collective identity was defined.
            &lt;br /&gt;
            The multidisciplinary group has the ambition of expanding itself on the limits of art, architecture and design, exploring creative ways to involve society to take a deeper look at our surroundings.
            &lt;br /&gt;
            Its creative process is defined by a concerned research for concepts, phenomena or theories that can be materialised to motivate reactions, seeking not only to represent but to accentuate the poetic dimensions of many elements that take part in the world we know, theorise and idealise.

        <a href="img/about/us6.jpg" rel="lightbox[about]"  Visible="false" title="
            The interventions of Suspeito arise mainly on the form of installation and scenography, imbued with an often performative load. Its restless and curious personality, wants to question itself constantly on new topics, not to just one predefined method neither the same working strategies.
            &lt;br /&gt;
            The approach to creation, through continuous investigation of themes, seek inspiration in humanities and social sciences, in natural phenomena and in more abstract theories.
            &lt;br /&gt;
            The execution is morphologically and technically diversified, involving an experimentalism that necessarily generates an implicit risk, to which Suspeito does not surrender.
            &lt;br /&gt;
            The group intends to assume itself as an artistic practice that works the relations of interdependence between three parts: art piece, receiver and space, which may focus more on one or another depending on each work or concept. By varying the used method - either by admiration, interaction or immersion - the ultimate objective is to create relevant sensorial experiences.

<!--
The RE = initiation project, launched by Ballet Contemporâneo do Norte, brings together 16 artists at a time of exceptional and global urgency, when the pandemic Covid19 hit Portugal hard and there was a mandatory quarantine between March and May 2020.
So, we decided to open 16 windows that connect our collective's houses to the rest of the world.
Working with visual effects that explore the potential of light – a recurrent research by the collective – we recorded audio and images from objects and products of everyday domestic life.
The project consists of a digital interface that enhances the activation of senses beyond audio and visual – embracing touch, smell and a fourth dimension through the sensation of movement – in a close relationship with the mediator that connects the user to the experience.
It is up to the viewer to decide which window or windows to open and activate, creating an enormous possibility of sound and visual relations between the 16 clips.
In addition to a relationship between the viewer's body and the technological device, it is also a relationship between that body and the creators' domestic space and equipment, in a game of sensations and spatial relationships in which the user commands the journey in this sharing of a place as intimate as it is distant.

                &quot;Alba&quot; is a multidisciplinary performance that blends contemporary dance, classical music, and literature, bringing together two institutions from Santa Maria da Feira — Ballet Contemporâneo do Norte and the Portuguese Philharmonic Orchestra.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Created in 2023, between the 50th anniversaries of New Portuguese Letters (1972) and the April Revolution (1974), the project explores the word freedom through a poetic, philosophical, and political lens. Inspired by the phrase “Freedom is the persistence of the laughter of those who can bear it without a grimace”, the piece questions the nature of the freedom we hold today, how it was achieved, and the challenges of maintaining it.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Treating freedom as a work-in-progress, the performance connects themes of resistance, revolution, participation, and citizenship. The title Alba refers to a Provençal poetic form describing dawn after a lovers' encounter, and symbolically evokes that transitional hour before sunrise — a space of imagination, magic, and liberation. The piece proposes a union of bodies — musicians and dancers — capable of announcing the dawn of April and echoing the emancipatory voice found in New Portuguese Letters.

				The project Azevedo by PELE is a regenerative artistic creation program that proposes to establish a dialogue between the territory of Azevedo (Porto), resident communities (human and more-than-human) and national and international creators. It awakens processes of collective creation and community participation, promoting the activation of common spaces through artistic intervention.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Colectivo Suspeito took part in the process of conceptualise and build a collection of pieces aimed to create an organic, changeable nomadic structure. A collective body capable of manifesting itself through its unity, but also through the autonomy of its parts. With those objectives 3 sets made of steel and wood were proposed to work together or individually as a kitchen, workshop bench and also a multifunctional device capable of unfold to different configurations and uses.
				&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Devices created and build for Azevedo project of PELE, Porto.

        		Prana is the energy that lives in each particle and interconnects them, no matter how different they are. It is the energy from which all other energies arise. A spiritual and philosophical concept, global and embracing, not only unique to Hinduism or Buddhism, it designates an omnipresent life force in the cosmos that allows everything to exist - from living things to inanimate objects.It is something we can breathe in the air, but it is also something much more intangible than that.
        		&lt;br /&gt;
				This installation intends to depict this notion of some kind of power which binds us, unites us as a single being and connects us with other beings and everything else around us. From micro to macro scale, it feeds life, making the world exists as we know it.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				The project consists of a light programmed to fluctuate its intensity at a slow and steady pace - an allusion to a type of breathing movement done with four distinct moments, as ancient Buddhist and Hindu practices recommend, marking a calm, gentle but paced rhythm and time. However, as visitors walk through space interacting with it and with each other, it is when Prana's energy awakens, intensifying its light but not changing its rhythm.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Technically, it is a suspended white LED line (in a circle, square or straight line depending on the space) synched with a low-frequency audio that might also reverberate in the bones, stimulating various senses: vision, hearing and touch. The amount of movement caused by visitors around the space is registered by a set of sensors that activates the electronic system making the immersive experience intensity deeper or more shallow, depending on whether less or more movement is detected or on the density of people inside the room. More people closer to the installation meaning a more intense response, as it would be a higher concentration of energy flowing.

        		Uncertain Compass is an installation which works with the instability of the body, turned into a sound object by the activation of the audience that explores it. The balance and strength of each person will act as the tools that make both the experience and the sound composition unique, which will react only to the human body and its movement and rhythm.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				It is a reference to a floating object and to the planet's water, simultaneously threatened and a threat to our society, today.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				It is also a particularly intimate form of navigation, of a surrounding journey, mental and sensorial, without leaving the place.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Compass being a tool for orientation and navigation in the planet, also refers to a tool for drawing circles and beat rhythm in music. In Portuguese, its original name also performs a sound pun, meaning “com passo”, literally translated as “with footstep” or using a more ambiguous expression “paced”, alluding to the small journey made within the circular unstable platform in the installation.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				The sounds were recorded with a contact microphone from objects using natural matter as wood, stone, clay or metal. The all resonate as white noises and allude to the four winds.

                Each Other is a project aiming to merge two distinct creative fields – architecture+design and performing arts - into the creation of several pieces that define, through a mechanical and scenic artefact, a place and physical condition for the viewer in relation with the other spectators.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In the same way there is, in each piece, an instructive proposal that guides the way in which the situation will be experienced, considering the user simultaneously the visitor and the performative body of the work. It articulates the conception and design of various objects to the dramaturgy of a performance based on the creation of three mechanical artefacts inspired by notions of unstable movement aiming to motivate the reflection on balance, relations, forces, weights, dependencies, presupposing to establish action-reaction dynamics between at least two people.

             	'Eu, Tu e o Balanço que nos (Des)Equilibra!', by Bárbara Mateus, 21.09.2019, MEXE ZINE Dia#6
				&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Um jogo de forças que nos convida à brincadeira, à exploração do objecto e à introspecção pelo poder da palavra. Assim é a proposta da instalação trazida pelo Colectivo Suspeito! - 'Each Other, (Un)Balanced' é uma estrutura de madeira que reinventa a construção de um baloiço, instalada no espaço público (na Estação de Comboios da Campanhã, no Metro da Trindade, na Estação de São Bento), onde se sentam as pessoas de passagem, sempre a dois, e num jogo de equilíbrios precários que desafia a relação entre ambos.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				É no silêncio que tudo começa, após nos sentarmos no baloiço e colocarmos os phones à espera de ouvir alguma indicação. Entre o silêncio e a palavra surge uma inquietude quase infantil que nos precipita ao movimento e à exploração do objecto, assim como a espera nos explora a nós. O silêncio por vezes pode ser tão constrangedor!!
				Entre um sobe e desce, entre o meu peso e o teu, entre as nossas diferenças, tentamos encontrar um sentido! 
				Quando a palavra surge, todo o nosso corpo fica suspenso no suspense da compreensão do que nos está a ser dito. Espontaneamente, o movimento pára equilibrando os baloiços, enquanto os pensamentos surgem desequilibrados pelas palavras. Toma-se uma dinâmica entre o exterior e o interior, entre o corpo e a mente. Enquanto o objecto nos convida à extroversão, a palavra convida-nos à introversão. 
				&lt;br /&gt;
				O texto provocador remete-nos à introspecção com base numa reflexão sobre a forma como nos relacionamos com os outros e connosco. De que maneira as nossas crenças e 'verdades' são um espelho dos nossos medos, dos nossos anseios, das nossas inseguranças que tentamos projectar no outro e que são igualmente, muitas vezes, projectadas em nós por outros tantos? De que maneira o poder que exercemos sobre o outro esconde o poder que não exercemos sobre nós? Poderá estar nessa sensação de falta de controle o impulso que nos leva a controlar as relações e, muitas vezes, ao abuso do poder como forma de mascarar uma verdadeira fragilidade e vulnerabilidade.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Sempre à procura, sempre aos altos e baixos, assim muitas vezes somos nós por dentro tal como o baloiço o é por fora! 
				E é nessa inércia, onde a palavra domina os pensamentos, que se torna insuportável aguentar o que nos é dito; numa fuga constrangedora, precipitamo-nos para a brincadeira do baloiço, entre o sobe e desce, entre o meu peso e o teu, na tentativa de não pensar mais.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Eis que surge um terceiro elemento, o Público!
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Desde o início presente, desde o início ausente e alheio à realidade que se está a passar. O Público observa com curiosidade, sem quase entender, enquanto os dois 'actores' abandonam o baloiço na esperança de que o Público nada tenha entendido!
				&lt;br /&gt;
				O Público toma-se num género de voyeur, quase um alter ego que causa algum desconforto nos transeuntes-espectadores-tornados-actores. Tudo isto se passa dentro da nossa cabeça, como normalmente acontece. A dificuldade em nos expormos de forma mais profunda por vezes é altamente constrangedora, a dificuldade em parar para nos pensarmos pode ser deveras perturbadora. Acredito que - será uma boa notícia? - é que a maior parte das vezes a censura esta em nós e somos nós, exemplo disso e este Público que tanto Observa mas nada Absorve!
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Arrisco-me a dizer que este trabalho pode ser considerado como uma experiência artística num laboratório social: eu, o outro e a arte entre nós! Foi como me senti.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Como dizia um grande mestre que ainda hoje guardo em mim: E a única verdade é aquilo que nós sentimos!

                Forma Informe questions the importance and meaning we attach to form as a defining element of something or someone. Why do we tend to define the world based on what we see when everything is much more than just the limits on which our eyes lie?
                &lt;br /&gt;
				The subjectivity of form as a concept is portrayed: something that our brain produces with the information captured by the eyes in order to synthesize and simplify our apprehension of reality. At the same time, it can complexify the world by changing according to the point of view from which we look, or the being and feeling of the beholder.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				What is its validity and why do we attach such significance to it? Why do we focus and limit ourselves to it when the thing we want to realize is so much bigger, more complex, more volatile than the way it appears to us?
				&lt;br /&gt;
				What matters to know in depth the object of our attention is to look at it beyond its form: in its matter, in its reasons for being but at the same time in its absurdity; in your order and in your chaos. The form itself does not say everything, but still we could say that the form does not matter?
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Something is always bigger and more complex than it appears.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Forma Informe explores the meaning of form as the defining element of something.

                (Un)Balanced is an interactive installation, built with wood structure, in which two swings are suspended, connected by a circuit of strings that work together, shifting in vertical oscillatory motion according to the weight and force imposed by the users. There is a subversion of the typical swing that uses a pendulum movement to front and rear with individual function, for this proposal it acquires an up and down action that is dependent on the binomial relationship.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The object has three definitions, 1) sculptural, with a minimalist elegance, 2) dynamic, providing fun, and 3) reflective of the relationship with the other. aims to be an analogy of human, social and political relations and as well a demonstration that balance only depends on the harmonious relationship between the parts.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Developed in collaboration with Patrick Hubmann (designer) for the event “Happy Together 2016” organised by Mala Voadora for Forum of the Future. It was also presented in Porto Innovation Hub and event Second Chance, both in 2017.

                Each Other is a project aiming to merge two distinct creative fields – architecture+design and performing arts - into the creation of several pieces that define, through a mechanical and scenic artefact, a place and physical condition for the viewer in relation with the other spectators.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In the same way there is, in each piece, an instructive proposal that guides the way in which the situation will be experienced, considering the user simultaneously the visitor and the performative body of the work. It articulates the conception and design of various objects to the dramaturgy of a performance based on the creation of three mechanical artefacts inspired by notions of unstable movement aiming to motivate the reflection on balance, relations, forces, weights, dependencies, presupposing to establish action-reaction dynamics between at least two people.

             	'Eu, Tu e o Balanço que nos (Des)Equilibra!', by Bárbara Mateus, 21.09.2019, MEXE ZINE Dia#6
				&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Um jogo de forças que nos convida à brincadeira, à exploração do objecto e à introspecção pelo poder da palavra. Assim é a proposta da instalação trazida pelo Colectivo Suspeito! - 'Each Other, (Un)Balanced' é uma estrutura de madeira que reinventa a construção de um baloiço, instalada no espaço público (na Estação de Comboios da Campanhã, no Metro da Trindade, na Estação de São Bento), onde se sentam as pessoas de passagem, sempre a dois, e num jogo de equilíbrios precários que desafia a relação entre ambos.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				É no silêncio que tudo começa, após nos sentarmos no baloiço e colocarmos os phones à espera de ouvir alguma indicação. Entre o silêncio e a palavra surge uma inquietude quase infantil que nos precipita ao movimento e à exploração do objecto, assim como a espera nos explora a nós. O silêncio por vezes pode ser tão constrangedor!!
				Entre um sobe e desce, entre o meu peso e o teu, entre as nossas diferenças, tentamos encontrar um sentido! 
				Quando a palavra surge, todo o nosso corpo fica suspenso no suspense da compreensão do que nos está a ser dito. Espontaneamente, o movimento pára equilibrando os baloiços, enquanto os pensamentos surgem desequilibrados pelas palavras. Toma-se uma dinâmica entre o exterior e o interior, entre o corpo e a mente. Enquanto o objecto nos convida à extroversão, a palavra convida-nos à introversão. 
				&lt;br /&gt;
				O texto provocador remete-nos à introspecção com base numa reflexão sobre a forma como nos relacionamos com os outros e connosco. De que maneira as nossas crenças e 'verdades' são um espelho dos nossos medos, dos nossos anseios, das nossas inseguranças que tentamos projectar no outro e que são igualmente, muitas vezes, projectadas em nós por outros tantos? De que maneira o poder que exercemos sobre o outro esconde o poder que não exercemos sobre nós? Poderá estar nessa sensação de falta de controle o impulso que nos leva a controlar as relações e, muitas vezes, ao abuso do poder como forma de mascarar uma verdadeira fragilidade e vulnerabilidade.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Sempre à procura, sempre aos altos e baixos, assim muitas vezes somos nós por dentro tal como o baloiço o é por fora! 
				E é nessa inércia, onde a palavra domina os pensamentos, que se torna insuportável aguentar o que nos é dito; numa fuga constrangedora, precipitamo-nos para a brincadeira do baloiço, entre o sobe e desce, entre o meu peso e o teu, na tentativa de não pensar mais.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Eis que surge um terceiro elemento, o Público!
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Desde o início presente, desde o início ausente e alheio à realidade que se está a passar. O Público observa com curiosidade, sem quase entender, enquanto os dois 'actores' abandonam o baloiço na esperança de que o Público nada tenha entendido!
				&lt;br /&gt;
				O Público toma-se num género de voyeur, quase um alter ego que causa algum desconforto nos transeuntes-espectadores-tornados-actores. Tudo isto se passa dentro da nossa cabeça, como normalmente acontece. A dificuldade em nos expormos de forma mais profunda por vezes é altamente constrangedora, a dificuldade em parar para nos pensarmos pode ser deveras perturbadora. Acredito que - será uma boa notícia? - é que a maior parte das vezes a censura esta em nós e somos nós, exemplo disso e este Público que tanto Observa mas nada Absorve!
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Arrisco-me a dizer que este trabalho pode ser considerado como uma experiência artística num laboratório social: eu, o outro e a arte entre nós! Foi como me senti.
				&lt;br /&gt;
				Como dizia um grande mestre que ainda hoje guardo em mim: E a única verdade é aquilo que nós sentimos!
